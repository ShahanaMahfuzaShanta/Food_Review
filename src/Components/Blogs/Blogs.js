            <p><b>Context API:</b> We need props to pass data from one component to another component. By Context API we don't need any props to pass data from one component to another component. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.</p>

                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold pb-2'>What is Semantic tag?</h2>
                <p><b>Semantic Tag:</b> Semantic tags are those tags which are meaningful for the browser and also for the developer. That means developer can easily understand the meaning of html tag which are semantic. Semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is. As a example, here I use b tag for bolt the text. Browser can understand that b means bolt and it will show that text in bolt from, bt developer can't easily get the meaning of b tag. When we use header tag for ceater header part, we can easily understand the meaning of header tag, that it will work for header and that's why it's called semantic tag. There are so many semantic tag. For example: header, section, footer, main, nav, summary etc.</p>

                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold pb-2'>Inline vs Block vs Inline-Block element:</h2>
                <p><b>Inline:</b> Inline element is those element which does not start on a new line. It does not take the full width. As example: span, b, i, button, img, q etc.</p>
                <p><b>Block:</b> Block element is those element which start on a new line and the browsers automatically add some space before and after the element. It always takes the full width. As a example: p, div, nav, main, h1 etc.</p>
                <p><b>Display Inline:</b> We can use a block element as inline element by using display:inline element. But we can't set the width and height.</p>
                <p><b>Display Inline-Block:</b> Display:Inline-block works just like as display inline. But we can set the width and height</p>
                <p><b>Display Block:</b> We can use an inline element as a block element bt using display:block. It will take the full width as like block element. And we can set width and height.</p>
